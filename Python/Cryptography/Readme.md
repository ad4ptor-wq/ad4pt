#  Simple Python File Encryptor & Decryptor

This project contains two simple Python scripts:
- `encrypt.py` — encrypts files using the **cryptography** (Fernet) library.
- `decrypt.py` — decrypts encrypted files using the key.

 Additionally: there is a symbolic "secret word" — `coffee`.  
It is used as a simple example for testing the scripts.

##  Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Library `cryptography`

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install cryptography
